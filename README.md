while implementing the Remote Health Monitoring System (RHMS), i found most of the basic class creation and method implementation straightforward.
defining attributes and simple methods in each class was easy.
however, i had some difficulty remembering which classes or collections needed imports, such as java.util.ArrayList and java.util.List, so i spent a little time researching that.
another challenge was designing the interactions between patient, doctor, alert, and feedback to make the system behavior realistic.
i also had to think carefully about how to simulate normal and abnormal vital signs and ensure the feedback loop worked properly.
